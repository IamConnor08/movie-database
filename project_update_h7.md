#Done So Far
-Started Python backend using requests and sqlite3 and storing data from TMDB API in a database
-Created react frontend homepage and working of filter feature
-Learning and researching React, sqlite3, and The Movie Database Website 

#What Needs Done
-Need to finish filter search and other pages need to be designed
-Backend needs to to pull from more than just TMDB (Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, etc)
-Database need more tables for user features (ratings, watchlists, favorites, etc
-Figure out the best way to connect the frontend, backend, and database together
-Reasearch more on React, sqlite3, and other movie websites to understand their layout so we can pull information from them.
-Changing some of the frontend to import from the database instead of current temporary JSON files. 


#Challenges So Far
-Connecting frontend to backend
-Handling how filter search will work with the database and backend
-Deciding what other APIs to use (a lot of them cost money or have usage limits)
